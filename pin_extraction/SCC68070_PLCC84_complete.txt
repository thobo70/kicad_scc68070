# Column Definitions:
# PIN    = Physical pin number (1-84)
# SIGNAL = Signal name (without 'N' suffix for active-low signals)
# TYPE   = I (Input), O (Output), I/O (Bidirectional), PWR (Power/Ground)
# POL    = Polarity: L (Active LOW), H (Active HIGH), - (Not applicable)
# DRIVE  = Output drive type:
#          PP  = Push-Pull (standard output)
#          OD  = Open-Drain (requires external pull-up resistor)
#          3S  = 3-State (tri-state capable, high-impedance possible)
#          -   = Not applicable (inputs, power pins)
# FUNCTION = Brief description of pin function

# Notes:
# - Supply voltage: VDD = +5.0V nominal, VSS = Ground
# - All 3-state outputs enter high-impedance when bus is released
# - Crystal frequency is divided by 2 for internal clock and CKOUT
# - Address bus: A1-A23 provides 16 Mbyte direct addressing (24-bit)
# - Data bus: D0-D15 is 16-bit wide, bidirectional, 3-state
#
# Pin Count Summary:
#   Total pins: 84
#   - Signal pins: 80
#   - VDD (power): 2 pins (1, 43)
#   - VSS (ground): 2 pins (22, 64)
#
# Open-Drain Pins (require external pull-ups):
#   - Pin 10: BGACK (Bus Grant Acknowledge)
#   - Pin 16: DONE (DMA Done)
#   - Pin 17: DTC (Device Transfer Complete)
#   - Pin 26: BERR (Bus Error)
#   - Pin 27: HALT (Halt)
#   - Pin 28: RESET (Reset)
#   - Pin 74: SDA (I2C Serial Data)
#   - Pin 75: SCL (I2C Serial Clock)
#
# Critical Design Notes:
#   - Open-drain pins require 4.7kÎ© pull-up resistors to VDD
#   - BGACK must remain HIGH to allow SCC68070 bus access
#   - RESET and HALT together enter Reset state
#   - HALT alone stops CPU/DMA after current bus cycle
#   - BERR+HALT together cause bus cycle retry
#   - I2C pins (SCL, SDA) need pull-ups for proper operation
#   - XTAL1 can accept external clock if no crystal used
#   - RDY can be tied LOW permanently for fast devices (no wait states)
