# Pin Statistics:
# ================
# Total pins:     120
# Signal pins:    80
# Power (VDD):    4 pins (45, 46, 105, 106)
# Ground (VSS):   4 pins (16, 17, 75, 76)
# Reserved:       8 pins (12, 52, 58, 70, 93, 99, 107, 108)
# No Connect:     24 pins (1-5, 27-31, 43-44, 60-64, 86-91, 120)
#
# Special Notes:
# ==============
# - All pins designated 'NC' or 'RESERVED' must not be connected externally (per datasheet)
# - Open-drain pins requiring external pull-up resistors (4.7kΩ recommended):
#   * DONE (pin 9)
#   * DTC (pin 10)
#   * BERR (pin 21)
#   * HALT (pin 22)
#   * RESET (pin 23)
#   * SDA (pin 92)
#   * SCL (pin 94)
#   * BGACK (pin 117)
# - Address bus: A1-A23 (23 address lines = 16MB address space)
# - Data bus: D0-D15 (16-bit data bus)
# - All active-LOW signals (POL=L) will have overline notation in KiCad symbols
# - 3-State outputs can be disabled during bus arbitration
#
# Consistency Checks:
# ===================
# ✓ All 120 pins accounted for
# ✓ No duplicate pin numbers
# ✓ Address bus complete: A1-A23 (pins 32-65 with gaps for NC/RESERVED)
# ✓ Data bus complete: D0-D15 (pins 95-115 with gaps for NC/RESERVED)
# ✓ Power pins: 4 VDD + 4 VSS = 8 total
# ✓ All open-drain signals identified
# ✓ All active-LOW signals marked with POL=L
