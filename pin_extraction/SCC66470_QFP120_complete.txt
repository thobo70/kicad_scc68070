# Column Definitions:
# PIN    = Physical pin number (1-120)
# SIGNAL = Signal name (without 'N' suffix for active-low signals)
# TYPE   = I (Input), O (Output), I/O (Bidirectional), PWR (Power/Ground)
# POL    = Polarity: L (Active LOW), H (Active HIGH), - (Not applicable)
# DRIVE  = Output drive type:
#          PP  = Push-Pull (standard output)
#          OD  = Open-Drain (requires external pull-up resistor)
#          3S  = 3-State (tri-state capable, high-impedance possible)
#          -   = Not applicable (inputs, power pins)
# FUNCTION = Brief description of pin function

# Notes:
# - All pins are TTL compatible except XTAL1 and XTAL2 (CMOS compatible)
# - POL column indicates signal polarity for proper KiCad symbol generation
# - Active LOW signals will have overline (bar) in KiCad schematic symbols
# - Open drain outputs (DTACK pin 37, INT pin 54) REQUIRE external pull-up resistors
# - 3-state outputs can enter high-impedance state for bus sharing
# - Memory address (MA) and data (MD) buses are 3-state for coprocessor access
# - Video outputs (V0-V7, PCLK, etc.) are 3-state for display disable
# 
# Pin Count Summary:
#   Total pins: 120
#   - Signal pins: 105
#   - VDD (power): 8 pins (15, 47, 76, 90, 95, 104, 120)
#   - VSS (ground): 7 pins (1, 17, 31, 45, 74, 96, 106)
#
# Critical Design Notes:
#   - Pin 37 (DTACK) and Pin 54 (INT) are OPEN-DRAIN: Must add 4.7kÎ© pull-up to VDD
#   - Pin 58 (RSTIN) has internal pull-up, Schmitt trigger input
#   - Pin 56 (CSYNC) has internal pull-up
#   - All bidirectional buses (D, MD, MA) must be properly terminated for signal integrity
